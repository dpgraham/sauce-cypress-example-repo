# EXERCISE

Now that you have been introduced to Cypress, I'm going to give you all the task of writing some Cypress tests. I'll give you three options

## OPTION A

Write tests for www.saucedemo.com (this is a test site, I'm not making you write tests for Sauce Labs ;))

For this activity, we'll make use of Cypress' behavior driven development (see https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/assertions.html#BDD-Assertions) and you'll write tests for the following four test cases

### TEST CASE 1
As a user, I should be able to log into www.saucedemo.com and then log out.

### TEST CASE 2
As a user, I should be able to add an item to the shopping cart and then check it out.

### TEST CASE 3
As a user, I should be able to add multiple items to the shopping cart and then get rid of the items.

### TEST CASE 4
As a user, I should be able to sort the items in reverse alphabetical order


## OPTION B

If you have another web application that you wish to write tests for, you're welcome to come up with your own test cases for that and write your own tests. And by the end of the workshop you'll have it set up in CI with GitHub Actions.

## OPTION C

Just take a break and don't do anything. I won't judge.
