# EXERCISE

For the exercise portion of this workshop, you will be given three choices of Exercises. Exercise A, Exercise B or Exercise C.

## EXERCISE A
Write tests for Sauce Labs Swag site **this is a fake site used for testing purposes, I'm not making you write tests for Sauce Labs ;)**

For this section of the exercise, you will be a QA Engineer for the next 30 minutes and you'll be writing Cypress tests. I'm going to give you 5 test cases and you'll try to get as much done as you can in the next 30 minutes.

The following use cases are all user behaviours that we wish to test. So I recommend that for testing these behaviours, I recommend that you use Cypress' BDD assertions https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/assertions.html#BDD-Assertions.

### CASE 1
As a user, I should be able to log into https://www.saucedemo.com/ and log out

### CASE 2
As a user, I should be able to sort items in the inventory in reverse alphabetical order (from Z to A)

### CASE 3
As a user, I should be able to add a "SauceLabs Bike Light" to my shopping cart and check it out

### CASE 4
As a user, I should be able to add multiple items to the shopping cart, start checking out the items and then cancel the purchase


## EXERCISE B

If you have your own website that you wish to test, then I encourage you to write your own test cases and make your own Cypress tests.

## EXERCISE C

Just hang out and relax until we get to the GitHub Actions exercise
